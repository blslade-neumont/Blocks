This project is a skeleton of a very basic block breaker game (Breakout). <br/>
The intention is to have the student add elements focus on the presentation of the game. These are the presentation elements that are expected:

* Audio (SFX/Music)
* Title/Game Over Screen
* Interpolation of object movement
* Effects
  * Particles
  * Trails
  * Screenshake
  * Material Effects
    * Flashing
    * UV Scroll
